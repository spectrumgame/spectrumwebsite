<h1>Introduction to the Basics of Spectrum!</h1>

<div class="row justify-content-center">

<p>Spectrum! is a shooter based on conversions. This means that winning a battle results not in your opponent dying, but rather them being converted to your team. Instantly. Without the typical die/respawn loop, play doesn't stop for anyone until everyone is on the same team, making for extremely fast paced and intense rounds.
</p>

<p>But the question that readily follows from such a mechanic is: Why should my new team converts want to help me? The answer is Spectrum's unique scoring system. In addition to gaining a point for each conversion you get, the system also awards what we call order points. Simply put, the earlier you joined the eventually winning team, the more order points you get.</p>

<p>
In this example with 8 players, the original red player will receive 10 order points, the second red player (originally orange) will receive 7 order points, the third 5, etc. until finally we have the last player (origninally pink) to be converted receiving 0. This point breakdown is different depending on how many different colored players there are at the start of a match. 

Players : [Score Totals]
8		: [10, 7, 5. 4. 3, 2, 1, 0]
7		: [8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
6		: [7, 5, 3, 2, 1, 0]
5		: [6, 4, 2, 1, 0]
4		: [4, 2, 1, 0]
3		: [3, 1, 0]
2		: [3, 0]

<h2>Motivations and Incentives</h2>

<p>Bottom half. Should you switch on purpose?

Trying to wait out your predecessor so you can be first.

Switching teams will just give other players conversion points.</p>
