<h1>Introduction to Spectrum!</h1>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-sm-10">

<!-- <h2>How to Play (to Win!)</h2> -->
<p>Spectrum! is a shooter based on conversions. This means that winning a battle results not in your opponent dying, but rather in them being converted to your team. Instantly. Without the typical die/respawn loop, play doesn't stop for anyone until everyone is on the same team, making for extremely fast paced and intense rounds. Players are awarded points each round, and rounds continue until a player accumulates enough to reach the target score, thereby winning the match.</p>

<p>Two questions readily follow: How are points awarded? And what makes a converted teammate loyal to their new team? The answer to both of these questions is in Spectrum!'s unique scoring system. In addition to earning a point for each conversion you get, the system also awards what we call order points. Simply put, the earlier you join the winning team, the more order points you get.</p>

<p>In this example with 8 players, the original (and first) red player receives 10 order points, the second red player (originally orange) receives 7 order points, the third 5, etc. until finally the last player (originally pink) to be converted to red receives 0. This point breakdown is different depending on how many different colored players there are at the start of a match.</p>

<h2>Incentives and Strategies</h2>

<p>If a player believes that their current team will end up winning the round, they are incentivized via order points to maintain their position on said team. If they get converted to another team and then converted back, they will have lost their original position and receive a smaller amount of order points as a result. Since everyone also gets points for conversions, each player is further incentivized to convert other players to their current team while not getting converted themselves.</p>

<p>But what if a player doesn't believe his team will win? Here Diamond converts Square onto his team. If this new blue team also ends up converting Circle and Octagon, Square will receive 2nd place order points (2 points based on the above table). But Square thinks Circle and Octagon are much too good and there is little chance either he or Diamond can convert them. If his prediction is right, he will end up placing 3rd (1 point) or potentially last (0 points) instead of 2nd. To avoid this outcome, Square lets Octagon (or Circle) convert him before Octagon converts anyone else. While that of course gives Octagon a point, Square won't lose position by switching teams (he is still in 2nd, just on the orange team now), and he has judged that teaming up with Octagon is more likely to result in him keeping his 2nd place position to the end of the match.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But let's say that 2nd place just isn't good enough for Square. The overall target score for this match is 50, and after many rounds Square has 46 points and Diamond has 45. Square is going to need 4 points (and at least 1 more than Diamond) this round to win the match!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This time, Square naively converts Octagon and Circle. 2 conversions + 2 order points gives him his 4 needed points. But Diamond has 1 conversion + 4 order points. Diamond and Square are now tied at 50!<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">2</a></sup></p>

        </div>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To avoid the tie, Square could try to get more than 2 conversions. After converting Octagon, he could hope Circle converts Octagon back, and then he converts Octagon again<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">3</a></sup>. This could go on ad infinitum, but Diamond could end it at any time by converting Circle.</p>

<p>Another way for Square to get 4 points is finishing 1st. After being converted by Diamond, there is no direct way for him to accomplish this, but if Diamond gets converted to another color, Square now becomes 1st on the blue team.</p>

<p>Should Square let Diamond fight on his own, hoping Diamond loses and Square becomes the new 1st player on the blue team? Or should Square try to beat Diamond to the other players and hope to get enough conversions to overcome his order points deficit? A good Spectrum! player is constantly asking these questions, taking into account the relative skill of the players in question, the current round's circumstances, and the overall match score to make the right decision.</p>

<p>This has been just a toedip into the basic strategies of Spectrum!. This article only dealt with the default scoring method, namely Conversions + Order Points = Total Points.

<p id="fn2">1. Octagon is of course under no obligation to convert Square. He may in fact find it unbeneficial to do so if Square only needs 2 points or fewer to win the match.<a href="#ref2" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↑</a></sup><br />

<p id="fn3">2. Ties in Spectrum! are impossible because we play to win. Rounds will continue to be played until someone is both over the target score and higher than everyone else.<a href="#ref3" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↑</a></sup><br />

<p id="fn4">3. This is called a juggle. While hard to control in FFA, juggles are an important part of team play.<a href="#ref4" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">↑</a></sup>
