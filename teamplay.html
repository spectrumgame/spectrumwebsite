<h1>Team Play in Spectrum!</h1>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
		    <div class="col-sm-10">

<p>In the first <a href="intro.html">article</a> of this series we covered the basic terms, rules, and strategies of Spectrum!. The examples there dealt with FFA mode, where each player starts on a different color team. Spectrum! also offers team play, where players start each round with their chosen teammates. While teams naturally form in FFA mode, such teams are very fluid, with players constantly reevaluating their allegiances. But for team play, you should always have loyalty to your original team, regardless of what color you find yourself as throughout the round. To that end, the formula for Order Points becomes more complex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-sm-9">
                <video width=100% autoplay muted loop playsinline>
                    <source src="videos/multiteam.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consider the above scenario with three teams (each player’s original teammates are indicated by the center dot). Should red or blue be counted as the 2nd place team? Since a member of the red team was converted to yellow first, they are treated as the second place team and thus earn more order points than blue<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. This rule for determining order points (that the highest placing individual from your original team serves as your representative) can lead to some counter intuitive strategies. To examine those strategies we will consider the simplest team play scenario: doubles.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-sm-9">
                <video width=100% autoplay muted loop playsinline>
                    <source src="videos/team1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
In doubles, each team is fighting for one of two placement scores every round: 1st place team gets 3 order points, while 2nd place gets 0.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> The initial order of each teammate is arbitrarily assigned. Here Diamond begins as 1st on the blue team, and Square as 2nd (likewise for the red team with Octagon and Circle). In the most simple scenario, the blue team readily converts the red, gaining 5 points (2 conversions + 3 order points).

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-sm-9">
                <video width=100% autoplay muted loop playsinline>
                    <source src="videos/team2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What if Square and Diamond wanted 6 points instead of 5? To do this, Square gives himself up to the red team. Now it will take 3 conversions for the blue team to win the round, but those 3 conversions plus 3 order points gives them 6 points they need.</p>

<p>As you might have noticed, this strategy does not actually improve the net gain of Square and Diamond, as they are still only up 5 points (the initial sacrifice of Square to the red team washes out the point received for his conversion back to blue<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>). To go up by more than 5, Square and Diamond need to perform a juggle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-sm-9">
                <video width=100% autoplay muted loop playsinline>
                    <source src="videos/juggle.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Similarly to before, Square sacrifices himself to the red team. But Diamond is no longer trying to end the game by converting everyone else to blue. Instead, Diamond converts only Circle to blue, and then Square converts him back to red. This is known as a juggle, and it gives Diamond and Square 2 extra conversions. This can be repeated ad infinitum for unlimited points!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-sm-9">
                <video width=100% autoplay muted loop playsinline>
                    <source src="videos/doublejuggle.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Diamond and Square can even perform a double juggle, where they juggle both Circle and Octagon! In addition to giving up 2 conversions, a juggled player also falls to the lowest placement on their color. So after a double juggle, Square and Diamond now control the two highest ranks on each color. They have guaranteed the 3 Order Points for this round!</p>

<p>
As evidenced by this short analysis of Doubles, team play in Spectrum! oftentimes requires your team to employ risky maneuvers, constantly keeping in mind the overall order of the players and how the optimal behavior of each team changes throughout the match. 3v3s and multiteam scenarios further complicate the challenge, providing a well of strategic depth to be explored.</p>

<p id="fn3">3. If the Count Changes scoring option was enabled, this would not be wash but instead a loss of 1 point for the Square and Diamond team (they would gain 5 points instead of 6).
