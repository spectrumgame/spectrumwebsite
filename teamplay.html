<h1>Team Play in Spectrum!</h1>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
		    <div class="col-sm-10">

<p>In <a href="intro.html">Introduction to Spectrum!</a>, we covered the basic terms, rules, and strategies of Spectrum!. The examples there dealt with FFA mode, where each player starts on a different color team. Spectrum! also offers team play, where players start each round with their chosen teammates. While teams naturally form in FFA mode, such teams are very fluid, with players constantly reevaluating their allegiances. But for team play, the scoring system needs to be tooled to properly incentivize absolute loyalty to your original team, regardless of what color you find yourself throughout the round. And while scoring conversions for each team is straightforward (sum up the total conversions for each teammate), awarding Order Points to a team is more complicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Movie here with 3 teams. 2 yellow 3 blue 3 red</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the above scenario with 3 teams (each player&rsquo;s original teammates are indicated by the center dot). Should the red or the blue team be counted as the 2nd place team? While a member of the red team was converted to yellow first, the entirety of the red team wasn&rsquo;t converted until after the entirety of the blue team. Should the first member of your team to be converted to the eventual winning team be the determining factor of your team&rsquo;s placement, or should it be based on when the last member of your team was converted (i.e. your entire team)? In Spectrum!, both of these team scoring options are available: named &ldquo;One for All&rdquo; and &ldquo;No Man Left Behind&rdquo; respectively. To highlight the differences between these 2 scoring options, we will analyze the simplest team play scenario: Doubles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In doubles, each team is fighting for 1 of 2 placements every round: 1st place team gets 3 order points, while 2nd place gets 0.* But while there are only 2 placements if we consider the teams as a whole, for the individual players there will be actually 4 placements. This individual order placement is important to understanding the strategies of team play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Movie. Square shoot circle and diamond shoots octagon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial order of each teammate is arbitrarily assigned. Here Square begins as 1 on the blue team, and Diamond as 2 (likewise for the red team with Circle and Octagon). In the most simple scenario, the blue team readily converts the red, gaining 5 points (2 conversions + 3 order points).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But presume Square and Diamond needed 6 points to win the match, not 5. To avoid risking another round of play, Diamond gives himself up to the red team. Now it will take 3 conversions for the blue team to win the round, but those 3 conversions plus 3 order points gives them 6 points they need. Who should Square convert to blue first?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If playing One for All scoring, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what order Square converts the other players to blue. Even if he converts Diamond last, Square will have retained his 1st place order on the blue team, thus ensuring his team receives the 3 order points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Movie</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But under No Man Left Behind scoring, converting Diamond last would be to disastrous effect. Square and Diamond receive 2nd place order points (0), because despite Diamond starting as blue, the pair of Square and Diamond (when considered together as a team) actually ended up being converted to blue after the pair of Circle and Octagon. To get the 6 order points they need, Square needs to be sure to convert Diamond first!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now while 6 is greater than 5, in terms of net gain Square and Diamond are still only up 5 points (the initial sacrifice of Diamond to the red team washes out the point received for his conversion back to blue**). To go up by more than 5, Square and Diamond need to perform a juggle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Movie</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly to before, Diamond sacrifices himself to the red team. But Square is no longer trying to end the game by converting everyone else to blue. Instead, Square and Diamond continually convert Circle back and forth, racking up conversion points. This is a juggle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Movie</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diamond and Square could even perform a double juggle, where they juggle both Circle and Octagon at the same time! Even better, as soon as Square converts Circle and Octagon the first time, Diamond becomes the 1st place player on the red team. Square and Circle now have the opportunity to get the 3 order points regardless of whether red or blue ends up winning, since they hold 1st place on both colors (in fact under One for All scoring, they have now guaranteed themselves the order points. The only thing Circle and Octagon have to play for is to stop the juggle. Contrast this to No Man Left Behind scoring, where Circle and Octagon can still take the order points similarly to the no juggle case)***.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As evidenced by this short analysis of Doubles, team play in Spectrum! oftentimes requires your team to employ counter intuitive strategies, constantly keeping in mind the overall order of the players and how the optimal behavior of each team changes throughout the match. 3v3s and multiteam scenarios further complicate the challenge, providing a well of strategic depth to be explored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* This comes from the scoring table <a href="intro.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>** If the Count Changes scoring option was enabled, this would not be wash but instead a loss of 1 point for the Square and Diamond team. You can read more about alternate scoring methods and their implications <a href="terms.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** As such juggling is much riskier move under No Man Left Behind scoring. It becomes even more perilous if multiplicative (as opposed to additive) scoring is in effect, as getting 0 order points will completely nullify any conversion points gained through juggling.</p>
