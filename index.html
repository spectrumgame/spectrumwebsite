<p>Spectrum is a revolutionary 2-8 player local party game.  In Spectrum, there is no respawning and no more waiting to get back in the action. Instead each time you kill someone, they instantly become part of your team! Each round ends when all the players are on one team.
<br>
<br>
The earlier you became you part of that final team, the more points you get (plus the number of kills your got throughout). So if you find yourself a latecomer to the currently dominant team, you might want to consider switching sides and trying to turn the tides. But then again, that distracted player in front of you would be such an easy kill! Spectrum forces you to constantly be evaluating your allegiances and alliances inside a fast paced, skill based combat system.
<br>
<br>
With 6 powerups to manage across 6 diverse maps (and more on the way), team-based and FFA modes, and multiple scoring systems to keep things fresh, Spectrum offers a wealth of competitive screaming-at-each-other-across-the-room fun for small to large groups alike!</p>
